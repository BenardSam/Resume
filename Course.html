    <h3>What is Industrial Process Control?</h3>
    <p>
      An industrial process control or simply process control in continuous production processes is a discipline that uses industrial control systems and control theory to achieve a production level of consistency, economy and safety which could not be achieved purely by human manual control.<br>
      It is implemented widely in industries such as automotive, mining, dredging, oil refining, pulp and paper manufacturing, chemical processing and power generating plants.
      There is a wide range of size, type and complexity, but it enables a small number of operators to manage complex processes to a high degree of consistency.<br>
      The development of large industrial process control systems was instrumental in enabling the design of large high volume and complex processes, which could not be otherwise economically or safely operated.

      The applications can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel, to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand control loops.

    <h3>What is Electrical design?</h3>
    <p>
Electrical design is the process of planning and designing an electrical system for a construction project.<br>
This includes the layout and design of all electrical components including wiring, fixtures, and equipment.
